			<h2>ABOUT US</h2>
			<p>Where the Chesapeake Bay meets the Atlantic Ocean!Family Owned since 1981, Waterman's Surfside Grille captures a slice of coastal living for the true flavor of Virginia Beach! Waterman's </p><p>Waterman's is actively involved in the Tidewater community. In partnership with the Virginia Aquarium, Waterman's participates in the Sensible Seafood Program, with the aim of helping consumers make sustainable seafood choices in restaurants. Founded in part by the Monterey Bay Aquarium in California, the program promotes serving seafood that is plentiful, well-managed, and harvested in environmentally friendly ways. According to the Aquarium's initiative, sustainable seafood comes from sources, either fished or farmed, that can continue to produce into the future without negatively affecting their populations or natural ecosystems. Locally caught sustainable seafood - like our Flounder which is caught right in the Chesapeake Bay - means it's eco-friendly as well. Look for the "fish in a circle" logo on our menu to guide you to sensible seafood choices, and check out more information on the Virginia Aquarium website!
