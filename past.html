					<h2>The Past</h2>
					<p>One of the main issues that always comes up for ex-offenders is the past. How does someone who has done so much to prove that they are always headed down a dark path, escape it. This is one of the points that each of the people I interviewed brought up. The past. "Why won't anyone forget the past?" "Why won't anyone believe that my past is behind me...an old skin to be cast aside?" "Why isn't it easy to convince people that I want to do the right thing?", ask each of my interviewees. The answers to these questions are not so black and white. There have been, in many cases, years and years of proving how rotten to the core they were, so it will not be easy. Many of these ex-offenders figured out a way to overcome those doubts.</p>
					<p>Most offenders are career criminals. That is a fact. "Very few people are sentenced to prison time on their first offense. They receive city jail time and probation. That is how they get you. Every time you mess up at all you are given a portion of the time over your head. "It can take around five years to kill a two-year sentence. And even then, you are not free", say most of my interviewees. This seems to be the sentiment among most of the ex-offenders I spoke with.</p>
					<p>For many ex-offenders, only when they have time to sit and think about what they have done to others does it seem to sink in. A lot of the offenders I spoke to were aware of how they have wronged people. They just want to have another chance at life, at friendships, family bonds, and careers. Some of my interviewees touch on these subjects, but none more than Tim Sisson. Tim is a great success story when it comes to regaining rights, as well as dignity.</p>
